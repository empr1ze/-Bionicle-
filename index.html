					<a href="https://biosector01.com/wiki/Tahu_(Generation_1)">
						<div class="text-box" id="Tahu">
							<span id="Tahu-Summary">Tahu is one of the boldest, fiercest, and most courageous of the Toa; however, this trait often manifests as hot-headed temper and aggression. Despite this fault, he is fiercely loyal to and very protective of his team, especially Gali. He takes being a leader very seriously, but in doing so he becomes impatient and does not feel inclined to get the opinion of his fellow Toa.</span>

						<div class="text-box" id="Kopaka">
							<span id="Kopaka-Summary">Kopaka is cold, aloof, and anti-social Toa. He prefers to work alone, and only agrees to team up with others when needed, and simply leaves company when his presence is no longer required. While he does see the importance of teamwork, he still feels uncomfortable by it. An intellectual by nature, Kopaka has an excellent understanding of how things work, as well as very good analytical skills.</span>

						<div class="text-box" id="Gali">
							<span id="Gali-Summary">Gali personifies the seas she calls her home, embodying the deepest, darkest oceans, but also possessing an aura of warmth and caring. She is gentle and kind, and often the only one who keeps the Toa from splitting up or doing battle amongst themselves. Despite attempting to be the peacemaker, Gali is often aggravated by the clashing attitudes of her teammates, and lashes out herself to quell their infighting. She is extremely wise, and recognizes the importance of the Three Virtues, and how they affect the team.</span>

						<div class="text-box" id="Pohatu">
							<span id="Pohatu-Summary">Pohatu is amiable, the friendliest in the team. He has good relations with all the Toa, and treats his villagers like equals, not subordinates. He usually jokes in times of danger and peace, boosting the morale of others around him. He always has a happy demeanor and is brave and dependable. During high tension between his brothers, he attempts to bring quarreling Toa together, though often to no avail. He never takes rude remarks too seriously and easily forgives his friends if they make a mistake.</span>

						<div class="text-box" id="Onua">
							<span id="Onua-Summary">Onua is a wise Toa, one of the wisest of his team, and is never impulsive or reckless. He does not speak without good reason, choosing only to speak when he sees worth in it, and is often silent as a result. His silence has puzzled others in the past, but he is known to be intelligent, and a problem solver. He is also very patient, understanding the value of waiting. He is reliable and steadfast, and was always able to be counted on. Although he knows when his teammates are making mistakes, Onua is willing to let them do so, believing in the value of knowledge gained from it.</span>
